| [Fibonacci Sequence Playground (better version)][fibonacci_sequence_better]      | By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 1 and 1, or 0 and 1, depending on the chosen starting point of the sequence, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. That's the only debatable part of the sequence. After that you can calculate the next number by adding the previous two numbers together.
