# Thinkful iOS Repositories

![N|Solid](https://cldup.com/vkMWNVd08U.png)

## Overview
This Thinkful-iOS repository contains xcode projects and playgrounds written for the iPhone in Swift 3.0. The content of this repository is the result of going through the [Thinkful][thinkful] _iOS Programming in Swift course_.

## Finding Your Way Around
This repository consists of a hierarchal series of folders corresponding to the course material, which is broken down into **_units_**, **_lessons_** and finally **_projects_** and **_playgrounds_**  in the following manner:

    |--- Unit ##
          |
          |--- Lesson ##
             |
             |--- Project(s) and/or Playground(s)
                |
                |--- etc.
                
    Where ## is the unit or lesson number.

## Projects and Playground Overview

Below is a table of projects and playgrounds that might be of interest to you. Relatively less interesting
projects and playgrounds, have been omitted.

| Project        | Description | 
| ------------- |-------------|
| [FizzBuzz Game][fizz_buzz]      | You start counting up from 1 to 100. Every number evenly divisible by 3 (3, 6, 9, etc.) is replaced with the word “Fizz.” Every number evenly divisible by 5 (5, 10, 15, etc.) is replaced with the word “Buzz.” Every number evenly divisible by both 3 and 5 (15, 30, 45, etc.) is replaced with the word FizzBuzz. 
| [XCPlaygroundPage Playground][xc_playground_page]       | Shows how to use XCPlaygroundPage to display a UIView object in the playground.  |
| [VisualShapes Playground][visual_shapes]       | Example of subclassing UIView to create a Shape class, used as a base class for other various shape classes. Uses XCPlaygroundPage to display the various shapes (views).  |
| [Fibonacci Sequence Playground][fibonacci_sequence1]      | By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 1 and 1, or 0 and 1, depending on the chosen starting point of the sequence, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. That's the only debatable part of the sequence. After that you can calculate the next number by adding the previous two numbers together.
