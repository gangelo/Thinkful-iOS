![N|Solid](https://cldup.com/vkMWNVd08U.png)

## Overview
This Thinkful-iOS repository contains xcode projects and playgrounds written for the iPhone in Swift 3.0. The content of this repository is the result of going through the [Thinkful][thinkful] _iOS Programming in Swift course_.

## Finding Your Way Around
This repository consists of a hierarchal series of folders corresponding to the course material, which is broken down into **_units_**, **_lessons_** and finally **_projects_** and **_playgrounds_**  in the following manner:

    |--- Unit ##
          |
          |--- Lesson ##
             |
             |--- Project(s) and/or Playground(s)
                |
                |--- etc.
                
    Where ## is the unit or lesson number.
