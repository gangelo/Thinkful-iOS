| Project        | Description | 
|:-------------|:-------------|
| [FizzBuzz Game Playground][fizz_buzz]      | You start counting up from 1 to 100. Every number evenly divisible by 3 (3, 6, 9, etc.) is replaced with the word “Fizz.” Every number evenly divisible by 5 (5, 10, 15, etc.) is replaced with the word “Buzz.” Every number evenly divisible by both 3 and 5 (15, 30, 45, etc.) is replaced with the word FizzBuzz. |
| [Grocery list Playground][grocery_list_playground]       | This playground demonstrates initialization and simple manipulation of String and Int(eger) Array's.  |
| [Population Growth Playground][population_growth_playground]        | This playground demonstrates the simple use of _for_ loops and functions, to output the population growth of a fictitious coutry, given an initial population statistic and growth factor, over the span of 100 years. |
| [Switches Playground][switches_playground]           | This playground demonstrates the simple use of the _switch_ statement and its benefits in comparison to the use of nested _if_ statements.  |
